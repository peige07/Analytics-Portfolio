This repository will serve as a compendium of the projects that I have completed. Most projects are showcased inside a Jupyter Notebook to show the data analysis thought process concisely.

Previews of each project with a short description and project link can be viewed below.

**Projects are broken down into 3 separate folders based on the way the analysis was performed:**
- Python Projects -  analysis using Python programming, visualizations created with Python, Excel & Tableau
- SQL Projects -  analysis using SQL specifically Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, visualizations created with Excel & Tableau
- Other Projects - projects that dont neatly fit into another category ex: websites created with HTML, CSS & JS or Excel-only projects

**Main skills, tools & softwares:**
- Python Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium & Pypyodbc
- SQL: Database Management, ELT, Data Migration, Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, Big Query & Large and Small Data
- Data Analysis: Collection, Preprocessing, Wrangling, Cleaning, Manipulation, Transformation & Exploratory Data Analysis
